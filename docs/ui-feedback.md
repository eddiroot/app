# UI Feedback

## Onboard Screen

- [ ] Hero image should be larger, probably make it the background to section the page and make it look scrollable
- [ ] Key features should come first, e.g. interactive lessons before discussions
- [ ] Add an intro before the feature section
- [ ] Include the name eddi earlier and make it clear.

## Dashboard

- [ ] Consider hierarchy for section i.e timetable should be much clearer and larger than school news, assessments > school news

## Subject Home

- [ ] Again consider hierarchy, dont need contacts to be as large as classes or assessments, remove contacts and move email next to teacher's name at the top

## Discussion

- [ ] If we split announcements with other make it so only teacher can write announcements and rename other to something else
- [ ] Maybe post announcement on class home page
